# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Project
This machine learning project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Python libraries such as NumPy, Scikit-learn, and others. We address the challenge by developing a binary classification model and experimenting with various machine learning techniques to determine the most effective approach.
