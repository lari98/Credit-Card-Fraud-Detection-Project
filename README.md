# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Project
This machine learning project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Python libraries such as NumPy, Scikit-learn, and others. We address the challenge by developing a binary classification model and experimenting with various machine learning techniques to determine the most effective approach.


# Credit Card Fraud Dataset
The dataset comprises 31 features, with 28 of them transformed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) due to confidentiality constraints. The remaining two features, "Time" and "Amount," were not subjected to PCA.

The dataset contains a total of 284,807 transactions, of which only 492 are fraudulent. This results in a highly imbalanced class distribution, posing challenges for model training and evaluation.


# Tools and Libraries used
We use the following libraries and frameworks in credit card fraud detection project.

Python,
Numpy,
Scikit-learn,
Matplotlib,
Imblearn,
Collections & Itertools

# Steps to Develop Credit Card Fraud Classifier in Machine Learning
Our approach to building the classifier is discussed in the steps:

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on our dataset
Apply different Machine Learning algorithms to our dataset
Train and Evaluate our models on the dataset and pick the best one.
