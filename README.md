# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Project
This machine learning project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Python libraries such as NumPy, Scikit-learn, and others. We address the challenge by developing a binary classification model and experimenting with various machine learning techniques to determine the most effective approach.


# Credit Card Fraud Dataset
The dataset consists of 31 parameters. Due to confidentiality issues, 28 of the features are the result of the PCA transformation. “Time’ and “Amount” are the only aspects that were not modified with PCA.

There are a total of 284,807 transactions with only 492 of them being fraud. So, the label distribution suffers from imbalance issues.


# Tools and Libraries used
We use the following libraries and frameworks in credit card fraud detection project.

Python – 3.x
Numpy – 1.19.2
Scikit-learn – 0.24.1
Matplotlib – 3.3.4
Imblearn – 0.8.0
Collections, Itertools

# Steps to Develop Credit Card Fraud Classifier in Machine Learning
Our approach to building the classifier is discussed in the steps:

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on our dataset
Apply different Machine Learning algorithms to our dataset
Train and Evaluate our models on the dataset and pick the best one.
